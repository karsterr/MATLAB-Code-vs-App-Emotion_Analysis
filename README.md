# MATLAB Code vs App: Emotion Analysis

A comprehensive comparison between manually coded MATLAB models and models generated using MATLAB's Classification Learner app for emotion analysis.

## 📋 Overview

This project demonstrates the differences in implementation, performance, and workflow between:
- **Raw MATLAB Code**: Custom-written classification models
- **MATLAB Classification Learner App**: GUI-based model generation

## 🎯 Project Purpose

The goal is to analyze and compare both approaches for emotion classification tasks, helping researchers and developers understand:
- Performance differences between manual coding and app-based approaches
- Code complexity and maintainability
- Model accuracy and reliability
- Development time and effort required

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **MATLAB** - Primary development environment
- **Classification Learner App** - MATLAB's machine learning application
- **Machine Learning Algorithms** - For emotion classification

## 📊 Features

- Custom MATLAB implementation for emotion analysis
- Classification Learner app-based model
- Performance comparison metrics
- Side-by-side evaluation of both approaches
